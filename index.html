        <p>My hobby is doing karate during the week. When it is Tuesday and Thursday afternoon I do karate classes. I am 11 years old and I am on my red with black in the middle belt. Karate teaches me discipline and never to give up on my goals. Anyone can do this hobby; however, they cannot use it for maliciousness. Every 3 months there is graduation to get to your next belt. In between graduations there are tests to see if you are doing good in karate. They are called stripe tests.</p>
